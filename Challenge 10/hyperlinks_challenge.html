       <h1>Something About Myself</h1>


       <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jadon.paulse/photos?lst=100006501519778%3A100006501519778%3A1522922693&source_ref=pb_friends_tl"><img src="13406943_1904179726475393_3792953543489978300_n.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt=""></a>

   <p>I am just an ordinary guy and I like ordinary things and one of those things is gaming which is something I have a passion for or a love for.......which ever one works best but gaming is a main thing for me,on the other side is samurai. I think samurai were the best people of their time and that we should have learnt a few things from them like how they respected and honoured their relationships with the people around them. We should do that and I like thinking I am like that because there's always making someone smile that makes happy. Seeing sad faces for me just means I am not doing a great job at helping, joy should always be present no matter what. I am a superhero fan as well because they are awesome and who does not like superheroes, like come on.</p>
